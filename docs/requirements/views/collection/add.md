# Add Document

As a user, I want to be able to create a document in a collection from the UI.

## Technical Notes

## Acceptance Criteria

1. An add button is present on the collections screen.
2. An ID can be provided by the user. If they do not enter a value, a UUID is generated for them.
3. The user can enter optional metadata key/value pairs:
   - A '+' button should be available to add additional key/value pair inputs
   - The user may add as many key/value pairs as they like
4. The user must provide content for the document.
