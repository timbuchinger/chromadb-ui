# UI Layout

As a user, I want to be able to trigger between light, dark and default mode for the colors used in the app.

## Technical Requirements

1. This should be implemented with a toggle in the navbar.

## Acceptance Critera

1. Default (or system) is the default value that will inherit its value from the setting the user has configured in their system.
2. The user can toggle through light, dark and system.
