# Collections Screen

As a user, I want to be able to create a collection from the UI.

## Technical Notes

1. 'Name' is the only attribute the user provides when a collection is created.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. An add button is present on the collections screen.
2. Duplicate collections are not allowed.
3. Only lower case letters, numbers, dashes and underscores are allowed in the name.
4. When a new colleciton is added, the list of collections is refreshed to reflect the new addition.
