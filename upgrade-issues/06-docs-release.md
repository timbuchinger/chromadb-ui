# Documentation & release updates

## Summary
Keep the README, tech context, and release docs accurate after the upgrade so onboarding instructions match the new stack.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update the README Quick Start port reference (Vite defaults to 5173) or change Vite’s dev server port to match the docs.
- [ ] Document the environment variables (host, protocol, tenant/database defaults) that the UI now respects.
- [ ] Refresh `memory-bank/techContext.md` (and CONTRIBUTING if needed) with the new testing layout and tooling.
- [ ] Describe the new workflows/tooling that contributors need to run (Vitest, updated CI jobs, etc.).
