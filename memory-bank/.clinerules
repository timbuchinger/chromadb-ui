# Project Intelligence

## Project Patterns

### File Organization

1. Vue components are organized by feature/screen
2. Requirements are structured hierarchically in docs/requirements/
3. Core system files are separated by function (stores, composables, etc.)

### Component Naming

- Screen components end with 'Screen' (e.g., CollectionsScreen)
- Modal components end with 'Modal' (e.g., AddCollectionModal)
- List components end with 'List' (e.g., DocumentsList)

### Styling Patterns

1. TailwindCSS is the primary styling solution
2. Dark/Light theme support is required for all components
3. Input and button styles follow consistent patterns
4. Color schemes are strictly defined for both themes

### Implementation Practices

1. Collections:
   - Names must be lowercase, numbers, dashes, underscores only
   - No duplicate names allowed
   - List views paginate at 20 items
   - Layout uses fixed height containers
   - Loading states use skeleton placeholders

2. Modals:
   - Used for collection creation
   - Used for deletion confirmation
   - Used for document viewing/editing
   - Include focus trap directive
   - Support keyboard navigation
   - Implement ARIA roles/labels

3. Notifications:
   - Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds
   - Manual close option
   - Four types: Success, Info, Warning, Error
   - Support backdrop blur
   - Limited width with text wrapping

4. Accessibility:
   - Keyboard navigation throughout
   - Focus management with clear indicators
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - ARIA roles and labels
   - Skip navigation links
   - Keyboard shortcuts support

5. Layout Stability:
   - Fixed height containers
   - Content height preservation
   - Smooth loading transitions
   - Consistent spacing patterns
   - Predictable content placement

### Component Patterns

1. Loading States:
   - Skeleton placeholders during loading
   - Spinner components for operations
   - Loading state in Pinia store
   - Content dimension preservation
   - Smooth state transitions

2. Form Validation:
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Type-specific error messages
   - Clear validation indicators
   - Consistent error styling
   - Accessible error messages

## Project Context

### Memory Bank Files

1. Located in /memory-bank directory
2. Core files:
   - projectbrief.md: Core requirements and goals
   - productContext.md: Product purpose and solutions
   - systemPatterns.md: Technical architecture
   - techContext.md: Development stack
   - activeContext.md: Current work status
   - progress.md: Feature tracking

### Development Flow

1. Features start with requirements in docs/requirements/
2. Screen components handle layout and composition
3. Feature components provide specific functionality
4. UI components focus on presentation

## Tool Usage Patterns

### File Operations

- Use replace_in_file for targeted changes
- Use write_to_file for new files or complete rewrites
- Check memory bank before making structural changes

### Documentation

- Update activeContext.md for current work
- Update progress.md for feature status
- Update systemPatterns.md for new patterns
- Keep .clinerules updated with new insights
- Follow markdown-lint standards:
  - ATX-style headers
  - Language-specified code blocks
  - 120-char line length limit
  - No trailing spaces
  - Single blank lines between sections
