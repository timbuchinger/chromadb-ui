## In Progress

- [x] Document metadata handling
  - No initial metadata fields shown
  - Required key validation with immediate feedback
  - Optional values support
  - Simultaneous validation error display
  - Enhanced form validation UX
- [ ] Document management interface (remaining features)
- [ ] Advanced collection features
- [ ] Additional error handling refinements

## Planned Features

- [ ] Add navbar to Login screen
  - Ensures consistent UI across all screens
  - Provides light/dark mode toggle functionality to users on the Login screen
  - Maintains app's visual identity pre-authentication
- [ ] Add metadata type selection
  - Allow users to specify data type for metadata fields
  - Support strings, integers, floats, and booleans
  - Add dropdown to select type when adding metadata
  - Ensures proper data type handling in ChromaDB
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Sorting and filtering
- [ ] Batch operations
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Known Issues

1. Document Deletion (High Priority)
   - Document deletion fails with "Collection not found" error
   - Error messages displayed redundantly in three locations
   - Need to consolidate error handling to use notification system
   - Requires immediate attention for core functionality

2. Protocol dropdown in dark mode has white background
   - Fixed by adding dark:[&>option]:bg-surface-secondary-dark to select element
   - Now follows dark theme color scheme

3. Favicon not displaying in browser tab
   - Need to investigate favicon.ico configuration in index.html
   - Ensure proper path and format for browser compatibility

4. Notifications UI
   - Notifications expand too far to the right and need width limiting
   - Text should wrap when it exceeds the width limit
   - Close button in top-right corner is missing or hard to see
   
5. Content Layout
   - Content jumps during navigation when loading indicator appears
   - Need to implement better layout preservation during loading states

## Next Development Priorities

1. Complete document management interface
2. Implement advanced collection features
3. Further error handling enhancements
4. Add automated tests
5. Document loading system usage patterns

## Testing Status
