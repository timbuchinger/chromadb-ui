## In Progress

- [ ] Document management interface
- [ ] Advanced collection features
- [ ] Additional error handling refinements

## Planned Features

- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Sorting and filtering
- [ ] Batch operations
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Known Issues

1. Colors inconsistent on login screen

## Technical Debt

1. Extract primary and secondary colors into common Tailwind config
   - Define primary and secondary colors centrally in tailwind.config.cjs
   - Refactor codebase to reference these colors consistently
   - Improves maintainability and consistency of theming

2. Extract Add Document Modal to its own component
   - Move modal code from DocumentsList.vue to AddDocumentModal.vue
   - Consistent with project pattern of separate modal components
   - Improves code organization and maintainability
   - Reduces complexity in DocumentsList.vue

## Next Development Priorities

1. Complete document management interface
2. Implement advanced collection features
3. Further error handling enhancements
4. Add automated tests
5. Document loading system usage patterns

## Testing Status

Planned implementation:

- E2E Testing (Cypress)
  - Navigation flows validation
  - Form input testing
  - Responsive design verification
  - Collection operations
