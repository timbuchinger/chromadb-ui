## Known Issues

1. Metadata Management (High Priority)
   - Cannot remove individual metadata items in Add Document modal
   - Must close modal and start fresh to remove fields
   - Missing remove functionality for each metadata field
   - Critical UX improvement needed for document creation workflow

2. Double Notifications on Document Deletion
   - Two success notifications appear when deleting a document
   - Need to consolidate notification handling to a single point

3. Content Layout Issues
   - Content jumps during navigation when loading indicator appears
   - Need to implement better layout preservation during loading states
   - Implement fixed height containers or skeleton placeholders

4. Awkward Delete Confirmation UX
   - In DocumentModal, delete and confirm buttons are red and far apart
   - Should switch position of confirm button for better flow

5. Protocol dropdown in dark mode has white background
   - Fixed by adding dark:[&>option]:bg-surface-secondary-dark to select element
   - Now follows dark theme color scheme

5. Favicon not displaying in browser tab
   - Need to investigate favicon.ico configuration in index.html
   - Ensure proper path and format for browser compatibility

6. Notifications UI
   - Notifications expand too far to the right and need width limiting
   - Text should wrap when it exceeds the width limit
   - Close button in top-right corner is missing or hard to see

8. Content Layout
   - Content jumps during navigation when loading indicator appears
   - Need to implement better layout preservation during loading states

11. Documents Screen Color Scheme
   - Header has the same color as the active row
   - Need to improve color contrast for better visual hierarchy

12. Authentication Persistence Issue
    - Once logged in, refreshing the page redirects to the login screen
    - Users should remain authenticated after a refresh

13. Navbar UI Enhancements
    - Add app name to the right of the logo with distinct styling
    - Add GitHub link beside the light/dark toggle
    - Fix inconsistent hover states for Collections and Logout links

## Next Development Priorities

1. Complete document management interface
2. Implement advanced collection features
3. Further error handling enhancements
4. Add automated tests
5. Document loading system usage patterns
