# Active Context

## Recent Changes

- Implemented ChromaDB-inspired color scheme across the UI:
  - Updated color system in tailwind.config.cjs
  - Standardized button styles with accent colors
  - Implemented consistent hover and focus states
  - Updated documentation in theme.md and systemPatterns.md
  - Added color scheme status to progress.md

## Current Focus

- Color system implementation:
  - Primary accent (blue-600) for main CTAs and focus
  - Secondary accent (orange-500) for hover states
  - Tertiary accent (yellow-500) for highlights
  - Error accent (red-500) for destructive actions

## Active Decisions

1. Color Usage Patterns:
   - Primary buttons use accent-primary with accent-secondary hover
   - Delete buttons use accent-error with opacity hover
   - Form elements use accent-primary for focus states
   - Interactive elements follow consistent hover patterns

## Next Steps

1. Component Updates:
   - Review and update remaining components for color consistency
   - Ensure all modals follow the new color scheme
   - Verify color accessibility in both light and dark modes

2. Documentation:
   - Keep color usage documentation updated as patterns evolve
   - Monitor and document any color-related usability feedback

## Current Status

- Notification system implemented with success/error/warning/info types
- Error handling improved with user feedback via notifications

  - Changed secondary accent to balanced orange (#f97316) for interactive elements
  - Added tertiary accent in rich yellow (#eab308) for highlights
  - Updated all components to use semantic color classes
  - Documented new color system in techContext.md

- Enhanced document metadata handling in Add Document modal:
  - Initially no metadata fields shown
  - Required key validation when fields are present
  - Optional values support
  - Improved UX with clear validation feedback
  - Enhanced form validation to show all errors simultaneously

- Created initial memory bank structure
- Documented core project requirements
- Captured technical patterns and constraints
- Established product context

- Implemented comprehensive loading system (see systemPatterns.md for details)
- Fixed double notifications issue
- Improved Metadata Management UI
- Implemented Layout Stability Improvements
- Implemented Authentication Persistence

## Current Work Focus

1. Field Validation Enhancement
   - Add clearer validation messages
   - Show validation status icons
   - Improve form field feedback

2. Feature Implementation
   - Document management interface in progress
   - Loading states implementation completed
   - Test loading system integration
   - Gemini Flash 2.0 provider integration planned

3. User Experience Improvements
   - Loading indicators implemented
   - Testing notification system integration
   - Further error handling refinements if needed

4. Testing Infrastructure Implementation
   - Setting up Cypress for E2E testing
   - Implementing Vitest for unit tests
   - Creating initial test suites for:
     - Navigation flows
     - Form validations
     - Responsive design
   - Configuring GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Active Decisions

1. Documentation Organization
   - Focused on clear separation of concerns
   - Established hierarchy of information
   - Created consistent documentation patterns

2. System Architecture
   - Vue.js based frontend
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Pinia for state management
   - Modal pattern for overlays
   - Notification system for user feedback
   - Centralized loading state management
   - Loading components design system

## Next Steps

1. Configure Deepseek through OpenRouter (High Priority)
   - Integration with OpenRouter API
   - Configuration and authentication setup
   - Provider-specific optimizations
   - Testing and performance evaluation

2. Improve Delete Confirmation UX
   - Address awkward button placement in DocumentModal
   - Switch position of confirm button for better flow

3. Implement Layout Stability Improvements
   - Add skeleton placeholders
   - Ensure smooth transitions during loading states

4. Fix notification system UX issues
   - High value: affects all error/success feedback
   - Low effort: mainly CSS changes for width/wrapping
   - Add visible close button
   - Will improve overall user experience

5. Resolve content jumping during navigation
   - High value: affects user experience on every page transition
   - Medium effort: implement fixed height containers or skeleton placeholders
   - Critical for professional feel of the application

6. Add metadata type selection
   - High value: ensures proper data handling in ChromaDB
   - Medium effort: UI updates and validation logic
   - Will prevent data type mismatches and improve data quality

7. Add navbar to Login screen
   - Medium value: consistent UI and theme toggle access
   - Low effort: reuse existing navbar component
   - Quick win for user experience improvement

8. Enhance Add Document Modal UI
   - Fix the jumping 'Add Field' button when adding the first field
   - Ensure 'Clear All' button is placed to the left of 'Add Field'
   - Tags: ux

9. Enhance Navbar Branding and Navigation
   - Add app name next to logo with distinct styling
   - Add GitHub link (https://github.com/timbuchinger/chromadb-ui)
   - Fix hover states for Collections and Logout links
   - Tags: ux, branding

## Current Considerations

1. UI Issues
   - Notifications expand too far to the right and need width limiting/text wrapping
   - Missing or hard to see notification close button in top-right corner
   - Content jumps during navigation due to loading indicator placement

2. Feature Completeness
   - Loading states implemented across all components
   - Verify consistent loading behavior
   - Address any loading state edge cases
   - Maintain accurate progress tracking

3. User Experience
   - Loading indicators provide clear feedback
   - Improved error handling with notifications
   - Consistent loading patterns across app
   - Notification system needs UX improvements

4. Documentation Maintenance
   - Keep progress tracking accurate
   - Document implementation status clearly
   - Track technical decisions and patterns

5. Theme System (Completed)
   - Extracted and centralized theme colors in Tailwind config
   - Implemented semantic color naming system
   - Updated components to use semantic color classes
   - Added status colors for notifications
   - Documented color system in techContext.md and systemPatterns.md
