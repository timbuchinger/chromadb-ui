# Active Context

## Current Status

- Notification system implemented with success/error/warning/info types
- Error handling improved with user feedback via notifications
- Loading system implemented with centralized state management

## Recent Changes

- Created initial memory bank structure
- Documented core project requirements
- Captured technical patterns and constraints
- Established product context
- Implemented comprehensive loading system:
  - Loading store for state management
  - LoadingSpinner component with size variants
  - LoadingSkeleton component for content placeholders
  - Loading states integrated in Collections and Documents screens
  - Loading indicators in all modals

## Current Work Focus

1. Feature Implementation
   - Document management interface in progress
   - Loading states implementation completed
   - Test loading system integration

2. User Experience Improvements
   - Loading indicators implemented
   - Testing notification system integration
   - Further error handling refinements if needed

3. Testing Infrastructure Implementation
   - Setting up Cypress for E2E testing
   - Implementing Vitest for unit tests
   - Creating initial test suites for:
     - Navigation flows
     - Form validations
     - Responsive design
   - Configuring GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Active Decisions

1. Documentation Organization
   - Focused on clear separation of concerns
   - Established hierarchy of information
   - Created consistent documentation patterns

2. System Architecture
   - Vue.js based frontend
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Pinia for state management
   - Modal pattern for overlays
   - Notification system for user feedback
   - Centralized loading state management
   - Loading components design system

## Next Steps

1. Test loading system integration thoroughly
2. Complete document management interface
3. Enhance error handling and user feedback
4. Set up automated testing infrastructure
5. Continue monitoring for new patterns and updates

## Current Considerations

1. Feature Completeness
   - Loading states implemented across all components
   - Verify consistent loading behavior
   - Address any loading state edge cases
   - Maintain accurate progress tracking

2. User Experience
   - Loading indicators provide clear feedback
   - Improved error handling with notifications
   - Consistent loading patterns across app

3. Documentation Maintenance
   - Keep progress tracking accurate
   - Document implementation status clearly
   - Track technical decisions and patterns

4. Theme System (Completed)
   - Extracted and centralized theme colors in Tailwind config
   - Implemented semantic color naming system
   - Updated components to use semantic color classes
   - Added status colors for notifications
   - Documented color system in techContext.md and systemPatterns.md
