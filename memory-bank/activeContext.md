# Active Context

## Current Status

- Notification system implemented with success/error/warning/info types
- Error handling improved with user feedback via notifications
- Loading system implemented with centralized state management
- Document metadata handling improved with clearer UX and validation

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced document metadata handling in Add Document modal:
  - Initially no metadata fields shown
  - Required key validation when fields are present
  - Optional values support
  - Improved UX with clear validation feedback
  - Enhanced form validation to show all errors simultaneously
- Created initial memory bank structure
- Documented core project requirements
- Captured technical patterns and constraints
- Established product context
- Implemented comprehensive loading system:
  - Loading store for state management
  - LoadingSpinner component with size variants
  - LoadingSkeleton component for content placeholders
  - Loading states integrated in Collections and Documents screens
  - Loading indicators in all modals

## Current Work Focus

1. Feature Implementation
   - Document management interface in progress
   - Loading states implementation completed
   - Test loading system integration

2. User Experience Improvements
   - Loading indicators implemented
   - Testing notification system integration
   - Further error handling refinements if needed

3. Testing Infrastructure Implementation
   - Setting up Cypress for E2E testing
   - Implementing Vitest for unit tests
   - Creating initial test suites for:
     - Navigation flows
     - Form validations
     - Responsive design
   - Configuring GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Active Decisions

1. Documentation Organization
   - Focused on clear separation of concerns
   - Established hierarchy of information
   - Created consistent documentation patterns

2. System Architecture
   - Vue.js based frontend
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Pinia for state management
   - Modal pattern for overlays
   - Notification system for user feedback
   - Centralized loading state management
   - Loading components design system

## Next Steps

1. Fix notification system UX issues
   - High value: affects all error/success feedback
   - Low effort: mainly CSS changes for width/wrapping
   - Add visible close button
   - Will improve overall user experience

2. Resolve content jumping during navigation
   - High value: affects user experience on every page transition
   - Medium effort: implement fixed height containers or skeleton placeholders
   - Critical for professional feel of the application

3. Add metadata type selection
   - High value: ensures proper data handling in ChromaDB
   - Medium effort: UI updates and validation logic
   - Will prevent data type mismatches and improve data quality

4. Add navbar to Login screen
   - Medium value: consistent UI and theme toggle access
   - Low effort: reuse existing navbar component
   - Quick win for user experience improvement

5. Implement search functionality
   - High value: essential for document management
   - High effort: requires backend integration and UI components
   - Critical feature for managing larger collections

## Current Considerations

1. High Priority Issues
   - Document deletion not working
     * Returns "Collection not found" error
     * Error messages appear in three places
     * Should consolidate to use notification system only

2. UI Issues
   - Notifications expand too far to the right and need width limiting/text wrapping
   - Missing or hard to see notification close button in top-right corner
   - Content jumps during navigation due to loading indicator placement

2. Feature Completeness
   - Loading states implemented across all components
   - Verify consistent loading behavior
   - Address any loading state edge cases
   - Maintain accurate progress tracking

3. User Experience
   - Loading indicators provide clear feedback
   - Improved error handling with notifications
   - Consistent loading patterns across app
   - Notification system needs UX improvements

4. Documentation Maintenance
   - Keep progress tracking accurate
   - Document implementation status clearly
   - Track technical decisions and patterns

5. Theme System (Completed)
   - Extracted and centralized theme colors in Tailwind config
   - Implemented semantic color naming system
   - Updated components to use semantic color classes
   - Added status colors for notifications
   - Documented color system in techContext.md and systemPatterns.md
