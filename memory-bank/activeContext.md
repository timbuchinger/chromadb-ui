# Active Context

## Current Status
Core features partially implemented. Notable gaps identified:
- Notification system not implemented despite being listed as complete
- Error handling needs improvement
- Loading states pending implementation

## Recent Changes
- Created initial memory bank structure
- Documented core project requirements
- Captured technical patterns and constraints
- Established product context

## Current Work Focus
1. Feature Implementation
   - Notification system development needed
   - Document management interface in progress
   - Loading states implementation required

2. User Experience Improvements
   - Error handling enhancement
   - User feedback system needed
   - Progress indicators implementation

## Active Decisions
1. Documentation Organization
   - Focused on clear separation of concerns
   - Established hierarchy of information
   - Created consistent documentation patterns

2. System Architecture
   - Vue.js based frontend
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Pinia for state management
   - Modal pattern for overlays

## Next Steps
1. Implement notification system for user feedback
2. Complete document management interface
3. Add loading states across the application
4. Enhance error handling and user feedback
5. Continue monitoring for new patterns and updates

## Current Considerations
1. Feature Completeness
   - Verify implementation status of claimed features
   - Maintain accurate progress tracking
   - Address identified gaps in functionality

2. User Experience
   - Implement comprehensive notification system
   - Improve error handling and feedback
   - Add loading indicators for async operations

3. Documentation Maintenance
   - Keep progress tracking accurate
   - Document implementation status clearly
   - Track technical decisions and patterns
