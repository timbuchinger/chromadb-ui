# Active Context

## Current Status

- Notification system implemented with success/error/warning/info types
- Error handling improved with user feedback via notifications
- Loading states pending implementation

## Recent Changes

- Created initial memory bank structure
- Documented core project requirements
- Captured technical patterns and constraints
- Established product context

## Current Work Focus

1. Feature Implementation
   - Document management interface in progress
   - Loading states implementation required

2. User Experience Improvements
   - Loading indicators implementation
   - Testing notification system integration
   - Further error handling refinements if needed

3. Testing Infrastructure Implementation
   - Setting up Cypress for E2E testing
   - Implementing Vitest for unit tests
   - Creating initial test suites for:
     - Navigation flows
     - Form validations
     - Responsive design
   - Configuring GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Active Decisions

1. Documentation Organization
   - Focused on clear separation of concerns
   - Established hierarchy of information
   - Created consistent documentation patterns

2. System Architecture
   - Vue.js based frontend
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Pinia for state management
   - Modal pattern for overlays
   - Notification system for user feedback

## Next Steps

1. Implement notification system for user feedback
2. Complete document management interface
3. Add loading states across the application
4. Enhance error handling and user feedback
5. Continue monitoring for new patterns and updates

## Current Considerations

1. Feature Completeness
   - Verify implementation status of claimed features
   - Maintain accurate progress tracking
   - Address identified gaps in functionality

2. User Experience
   - Implement comprehensive notification system
   - Improve error handling and feedback
   - Add loading indicators for async operations

3. Documentation Maintenance
   - Keep progress tracking accurate
   - Document implementation status clearly
   - Track technical decisions and patterns

4. Theme System (Completed)
   - Extracted and centralized theme colors in Tailwind config
   - Implemented semantic color naming system
   - Updated components to use semantic color classes
   - Added status colors for notifications
   - Documented color system in techContext.md and systemPatterns.md
